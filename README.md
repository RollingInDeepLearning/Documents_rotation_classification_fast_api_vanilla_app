# Documents Rotation Classification FastAPI Vanilla App

The goal of this project is to create a service that classifies the rotation angle of a document image uploaded by a donor. The document is not standardized and can be in the form of a screenshot or a photograph, often rotated. The service can be part of an image processing pipeline.

This project has been prepared as part of a volunteer initiative organized by "Masterskaya" by Yandex Practicum.

## Repository Contains:
* A model research folder where .ipynb notebooks and datasets are stored; different models are trained in the .ipynb notebooks.
* A data processing folder where some tools for data processing are stored.
* A donor-app folder with a ready-to-use service.
